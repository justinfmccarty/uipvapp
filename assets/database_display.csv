The school was initally designed ot include a metal facade system that was supposedly cost comparable with BIPV whihc made convincing other board memebrs of the BIPV worth. The BIPV elements are all fixed but with different tilt thus leading to inevitable shading. This is minimized with a micro-inverter system that is stored in the plenums for easier access. There was a time when the system was sending too much to the grid and the utility needed to shut it down. The North facade is covered in panels, but not connected to the system and meant to serve as a bank of replacement.", - A BIPV advocate needs to be consistent throughout the project or it may dissapear. - Shading and partial shading can be overcome to optimize aesthetic over performance. - Utilties may hinder the overall performance if not prepared to receive generated electricty. - Clear and comfortable site and installation area access is key to faster and less error-prone installations.,"https://actu.epfl.ch/news/the-school-with-the-largest-solar-facade-in-the--5/, https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/zero-energy-building-denmark/44444/",,25,50,,25000.0,,Integrated,,micro,,,,720.0,6000,371.5277778,0.0,267500.0,,,,20_110_200_290,facade,86_94,custom,Crystalline,Mono,,,700x700,,,1,,No, - general https://iea-pvps.org/key-topics/succesful-building-integration-of-photovoltaics-a-collection-of-international-projects/ - retail rate https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Denmark/electricity_prices/,denmark_school,,,,,,,,,267500.0,267500.0
