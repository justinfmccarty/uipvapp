This repository serves as a collection point for buildings and infrastructure that have integrated solar energy technologies, most prominently building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). The repository can be explored through a map tool with basic filtering functionality. Along with the map explorer we have included a set of plots to explore the projects through their performance and inherent characteristics (i.e. type of project, annual yield, system efficiency, etc.). As we expand the repository with more projects expect more resources for various audiences, such as design booklets for BIPV, reference materials for engineering standards, and interactive performance calculators based on our BIPV performance model.
