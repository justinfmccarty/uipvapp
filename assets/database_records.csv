ENERGYbase,IEA Case Studies,New Construction,2008,2008,Austria,48.268544,16.427198,Office,Constructed in 2008 this new construction facility features two rows of PV and glass elements for each building level. The facade design was optimized to allow for daylight to move throughout the office space from the southern facade., - BIPV should not be evaluated solely on investment cost. - Integrating the BIPV design into the building design process does not necessarily mean you will have to make signifiacnt tradeoffs anywhere in the building. - Details are very significant in the final performance of the facade systems. - More public funding for research should be provided to realize projects like this.,https://bipv.eurac.edu/en/case-studies/energybase-office.html,0.198,na,,,na,,Integrated Facade,,standard,,2382_AUD/m2,,48.2,400,880,na,42416,Net-meter,,100,180,facade,31.5,lamination,,glass-glass monocrystalline silicon,,1520x720,,1,,No, - general https://iea-pvps.org/key-topics/succesful-building-integration-of-photovoltaics-a-collection-of-international-projects/ - retail rate https://www.statista.com/statistics/596258/electricity-industry-price-austria/,energybase,0.18,3.1,0.01,
Harbourfront Centre Theatre,IEA Case Studies,Retrofit,2010,1926,Canada,43.638322,-79.381971,Civic,"The Harbourfront Centre Theater is a signifiacnt attraction in Toronto, and well known throughout Canada. The building was built in 1926 as a place for massive ice blocks to be stored after being harvested from Lake Ontario. In 1986 the space was originally repurposed into a theatre. Near the time of the latest retrofit the exterior curtain system was failing. The BIPC curtain wall was integrated into the new triple-glazed facade and designed to match the art installation (or vice-versa).", - Inverter solutions are not flexible enough for small systems. - Working with utilties that are not knowledgeable in PV or BIPV can delay projects significantly.,https://www.acotoronto.ca/show_building.php?BuildingID=3099,,na,,,na,,Integrated Glazing,,standard,,,,1.4,21.5,1071,1500,na,Net-meter,,na,253,roof,45,na,,monocrystalline silicon,,1549x1260,,1,,No, - general https://iea-pvps.org/key-topics/succesful-building-integration-of-photovoltaics-a-collection-of-international-projects/ - retail rate https://www.torontohydro.com/for-business/rates,harbourfront,,,,
Brynseng Primary School,IEA Case Studies,New Construction,2017,2017,Norway,59.908781,10.811339,School,"Following a career of passive house demonstration this firm dedicated this project to being a nZEB with an RES. Late in the project planning phase a suggestion was made ot alter the facade to include BIPV, as the roof was not available. This proved successful in fundraising. As this was an early BIPV project the municipality was hesitant to award permission for the new facade based on unknowns in the glass, fire, and electrical safety standardization of the components. However it was agreed upon to be installed under close coordination between all teams. The BIPV was integrated into the curriculum of the school as a learning element and is featured in an all black finish that is apparaent from afar but not necessarily obvious as solar panels. The modules are effecticley back-ventilated cladding.", - The BIPV was added later in the design process and therefore suffers from soe self-building shading.  - Unclear regulations stifled progress at times and due to this being a new type of component the tendering process and pricing was unclear. - Without clear fire regulations the local fire team trained on the system to understand how it and similar installations may need ot be addressed. - Custom modules and various sizes complicated pricing.,https://bipv.eurac.edu/en/case-studies/brynseng-primary-school.html,0.144,40,25,,11600,,Integrated,,standard,,1228_AUD/m2,,166,1046,633,na,105000,Net-meter,,100,185,facade,90,custom z-girts,,monocrystalline silicon,,variety,,26,,No, - general https://iea-pvps.org/key-topics/succesful-building-integration-of-photovoltaics-a-collection-of-international-projects/ - retail rate https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Norway/electricity_prices/,brynseng,0.05,1.5,0.001,
Copenhagen International School,IEA Case Studies,New Construction,2017,2017,Denmark,55.711795,12.598121,School,"The inclusion of BIPV was insisted upon by one member of the board that oversaw the project. The school was initally designed ot include a metal facade system that was supposedly cost comparable with BIPV whihc made convincing other board memebrs of the BIPV worth. The BIPV elements are all fixed but with different tilt thus leading to inevitable shading. This is minimized with a micro-inverter system that is stored in the plenums for easier access. There was a time when the system was sending too much to the grid and the utility needed to shut it down. The North facade is covered in panels, but not connected to the system and meant to serve as a bank of replacement.", - A BIPV advocate needs to be consistent throughout the project or it may dissapear. - Shading and partial shading can be overcome to optimize aesthetic over performance. - Utilties may hinder the overall performance if not prepared to receive generated electricty. - Clear and comfortable site and installation area access is key to faster and less error-prone installations.,https://actu.epfl.ch/news/the-school-with-the-largest-solar-facade-in-the--5/,,25,50,,25000,,Integrated,,micro,,,,720,6000,371.5277778,na,267500,na,,na,20_110_200_290,facade,86_94,custom,,,,700x700,,1,,No, - general https://iea-pvps.org/key-topics/succesful-building-integration-of-photovoltaics-a-collection-of-international-projects/ - retail rate https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Denmark/electricity_prices/,denmark_school,,,,
