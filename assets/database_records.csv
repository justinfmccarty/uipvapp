Late in the project planning phase a suggestion was made ot alter the facade to include BIPV, as the roof was not available. This proved successful in fundraising. As this was an early BIPV project the municipality was hesitant to award permission for the new facade based on unknowns in the glass, fire, and electrical safety standardization of the components. However it was agreed upon to be installed under close coordination between all teams. The BIPV was integrated into the curriculum of the school as a learning element and is featured in an all black finish that is apparaent from afar but not necessarily obvious as solar panels. The modules are effecticley back-ventilated cladding.", - The BIPV was added later in the design process and therefore suffers from soe self-building shading.  - Unclear regulations stifled progress at times and due to this being a new type of component the tendering process and pricing was unclear. - Without clear fire regulations the local fire team trained on the system to understand how it and similar installations may need ot be addressed. - Custom modules and various sizes complicated pricing.,https://bipv.eurac.edu/en/case-studies/brynseng-primary-school.html,0.144,40,25,,11600,,Integrated,,standard,,1228_AUD/m2,,166,1046,633,,105000,Net-meter,,100,185,facade,90,custom z-girts,Crystalline,Mono,,,variety,,26,,No, - general https://iea-pvps.org/key-topics/succesful-building-integration-of-photovoltaics-a-collection-of-international-projects/ - retail rate https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Norway/electricity_prices/,brynseng,0.05,1.5,0.001,

Copenhagen International School,IEA Case Studies,New Construction,2017,2017,Denmark,55.711795,12.598121,School,"The inclusion of BIPV was insisted upon by one member of the board that oversaw the project. The school was initally designed ot include a metal facade system that was supposedly cost comparable with BIPV whihc made convincing other board memebrs of the BIPV worth. The BIPV elements are all fixed but with different tilt thus leading to inevitable shading. This is minimized with a micro-inverter system that is stored in the plenums for easier access. There was a time when the system was sending too much to the grid and the utility needed to shut it down. The North facade is covered in panels, but not connected to the system and meant to serve as a bank of replacement.", - A BIPV advocate needs to be consistent throughout the project or it may dissapear. - Shading and partial shading can be overcome to optimize aesthetic over performance. - Utilties may hinder the overall performance if not prepared to receive generated electricty. - Clear and comfortable site and installation area access is key to faster and less error-prone installations.,"https://actu.epfl.ch/news/the-school-with-the-largest-solar-facade-in-the--5/, https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/zero-energy-building-denmark/44444/",,25,50,,25000,,Integrated,,micro,,,,720,6000,371.5277778,,267500,,,,20_110_200_290,facade,86_94,custom,Crystalline,Mono,,,700x700,,1,,No, - general https://iea-pvps.org/key-topics/succesful-building-integration-of-photovoltaics-a-collection-of-international-projects/ - retail rate https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Denmark/electricity_prices/,denmark_school,,,,
